            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p> My name is Ruben Ruiz, and I'm currently employed as a Technical Support Secialist at Bleubeam
                Inc. I look to transition into a full stack developer. With over 7 years of experience in technical support and troubleshooting, I've developed a strong foundation in software and various operating systems. However, I've always been passionate about development and decided to pursue a career in it. </p>
            <p>
                I'm now excited to leverage my technical support experience and new development skills to become a
                back-end developer.</p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry developments. I'm a detail-oriented problem solver, and I'm
                committed to delivering high-quality work that meets the needs of my clients and users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me! If you have any questions or would like to work together, please don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>
